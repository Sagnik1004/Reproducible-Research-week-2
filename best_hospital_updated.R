#Write a function called best that take two arguments: the 2-character abbreviated name of a state and an
#outcome name. The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns a character vector
#with the name of the hospital that has the best (i.e. lowest) 30-day mortality for the specified outcome
#in that state. The hospital name is the name provided in the Hospital.Name variable. The outcomes can
#be one of “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”. Hospitals that do not have data on a particular
#outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings
#Handling ties. If there is a tie for the best hospital for a given outcome, then the hospital names should
#be sorted in alphabetical order and the first hospital in that set should be chosen (i.e. if hospitals “b”, “c”,
#and “f” are tied for best, then hospital “b” should be returned).
#The function should use the following template.
#best <- function(state, outcome) {
#  ## Read outcome data
#  ## Check that state and outcome are valid
#  ## Return hospital name in that state with lowest 30-day death
#  ## rate
#}

#The function should check the validity of its arguments. If an invalid state value is passed to best, the
#function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact message “invalid state”. If an invalid
#outcome value is passed to best, the function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact
#message “invalid outcome
#Here is some sample output from the function.
